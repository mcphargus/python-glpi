#+TITLE: Python API for Calling GLPI Webservices

* What it is

  This project started a small script to enable nagios to generate
  tickets in GLPI upon alerts. Then I decided I needed a fuller
  pythonic api to my GLPI server.

** Status Update <2018-07-08 Sun 15:43>   
   
   Migrated from urllib to requests to be compatible with Python 2 and Python 3. 

** Status Update <2012-10-17 Wed 13:20>   
   
   I've wrtten examples to test some of these methods. 

** Status Update <2012-10-08 Mon >
   Please note: as of 2012-10-08, most of these methods are untested,
   and this is completely a work in progress. I will update this
   README file or the github wiki for this project as I complete
   tests.

* Want to help?

  Anyone willing, feel free to test these APIs along with me and email
  me their results and suggestions (address is in pyglpy.py).
